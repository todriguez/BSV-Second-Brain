# Halving

**Halving** refers to the scheduled reduction of block rewards given to miners for successfully mining a new block in the [[BSV Blockchain]]. This mechanism is part of the [[BSV Protocol]] and occurs every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Halving ensures a gradual reduction in the rate at which new coins are introduced into the system, aligning with the protocol’s finite issuance schedule.

## How Halving Works

1. **Block Rewards**:
   - The reward for mining a block starts at 50 coins.
   - With each halving, the reward is reduced by half. For example:
     - **First Halving**: Reduced to 25 coins per block.
     - **Second Halving**: Reduced to 12.5 coins per block.
     - **Current Reward**: Continues to halve with each event.

2. **Halving Schedule**:
   - Halvings occur every 210,000 blocks.
   - At an average of one block every 10 minutes, this translates to a halving approximately every four years.

3. **Total Supply Cap**:
   - The protocol ensures that no more than 21 million coins will ever exist, with halvings reducing the issuance rate until the cap is reached.

## Implications of Halving

### 1. **Transition to Transaction Fees**
   - As [[block subsidy]] decrease, the incentive for miners will increasingly depend on [[Transaction Fees]].
   - Higher transaction volumes and unbounded block sizes in BSV ensure sufficient fee-based revenue for miners over time.

### 2. **Sustainability**
   - Halving ensures the system adheres to the predefined issuance schedule, supporting long-term network operations.
   - Miners are incentivized to prioritize efficient block production and economic fee structures.

### 3. **Scaling Advantage**
   - [[BSV Blockchain]]’s ability to scale massively through large block sizes enables high transaction throughput, offsetting the reduced block subsidy.
   - This approach is unique compared to other blockchain implementations and ensures miner sustainability.

## Key Considerations

1. **Miner Economics**:
   - The transition from block rewards to fee-based incentives is critical for maintaining network security and miner profitability.

2. **Scalability**:
   - BSV’s [[Unbounded Block Size]] ensures that the network can handle increasing transaction volumes, allowing miners to earn fees even as the block subsidy diminishes.

3. **Protocol Integrity**:
   - Halving reinforces the predictability and consistency of the [[BSV Protocol]], making it a reliable system for commercial and enterprise applications.
