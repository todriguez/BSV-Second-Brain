## SHA-256: Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit

**SHA-256** is a cryptographic hash function designed by the [[National Security Agency (NSA)]] and published by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] as part of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) family. It is widely used in [[cryptography]], data integrity verification, and blockchain systems like [[BSV Blockchain]].

### Key Features of SHA-256

1. **Deterministic**:
   - The same input always produces the same 256-bit (32-byte) output.

2. **Fixed Output Size**:
   - Produces a hash of exactly 256 bits, regardless of the input size.

3. **Preimage Resistance**:
   - It is computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the input from the output.

4. **Collision Resistance**:
   - It is highly unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash.

5. **Avalanche Effect**:
   - A small change in the input drastically changes the output hash.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - SHA-256 is computationally efficient and can process large datasets relatively quickly.

### The Role of SHA-256 in Bitcoin

SHA-256 plays a foundational role in the [[Bitcoin]] ecosystem, contributing to its security, immutability, and decentralized operation:

1. **Proof of Work (PoW)**:
   - SHA-256 is used in the mining process to calculate block header hashes.
   - Miners repeatedly hash block headers with a varying [[nonce]] until they find a hash below the [[difficulty target]].

2. **Transaction Integrity**:
   - Transactions are hashed using SHA-256 to create [[Transaction ID (TXID)|TXIDs]].
   - Ensures data integrity and prevents tampering.

3. **Merkle Tree Construction**:
   - SHA-256 is used to compute [[Merkle Root|Merkle roots]] from transaction hashes, enabling efficient transaction verification in blocks.

4. **Double SHA-256**:
   - Bitcoin employs a double SHA-256 process (hashing the hash) to ensure additional security against vulnerabilities.

### How SHA-256 Works

SHA-256 operates on a **compression function** that processes input data in fixed-size blocks of 512 bits (64 bytes):

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - The input is padded to a multiple of 512 bits and includes a 64-bit length field.
   - A 256-bit initial hash value is set.

2. **Processing**:
   - The data is divided into 512-bit blocks, which are processed sequentially.
   - Each block is compressed into the hash state using a series of bitwise operations, modular additions, and logical functions.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all blocks, a 256-bit hash is produced.

**Mathematical Representation**:
$$ H(x) = \text{SHA-256}(x) $$

Where \( H(x) \) is the 256-bit hash, and \( x \) is the input.

### Example: Hashing with SHA-256

**Input**:  
`"Hello, Bitcoin!"`

**Output** (in hexadecimal):  
`f0ed6d8edb8b5d5b4775bb9cbcf83a9c13e32eec979f589a1a3edc4159f2dc8d`

### Importance in BSV

In the [[BSV Blockchain]], SHA-256 is integral to:

1. **Scalability**:
   - Ensures efficient validation of massive transaction volumes.
   
2. **Immutability**:
   - Provides a cryptographically secure method for linking blocks and ensuring the integrity of transaction data.

3. **SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)**:
   - Enables lightweight nodes to verify transactions using Merkle proofs without downloading full blocks.

### Limitations of SHA-256

1. **Quantum Vulnerability**:
   - Future advancements in [[quantum computing]] could weaken preimage resistance.
   - Mitigation: Transition to quantum-resistant algorithms if needed.

2. **Computational Cost**:
   - Although efficient, hashing at scale (e.g., in mining) requires significant computational resources.

### SHA-256 in Real-World Applications

1. **Blockchain**:
   - Powers the security of distributed ledgers like BSV.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - Ensures the integrity of signed documents and transactions.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Verifies that files and data have not been tampered with.

4. **Password Hashing**:
   - Secures stored passwords, though stronger algorithms like bcrypt are preferred for this use case.
