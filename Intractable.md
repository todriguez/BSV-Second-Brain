# Overview

**Intractable** often describes problems, situations, or conditions that are difficult to manage, manipulate, or solve. It is typically used in contexts where there are high levels of complexity and where simple solutions are not readily available.

# Intractable Problems

Sometimes, the term **Intractable** is used to denote problems that are especially difficult to deal with. These problems can be found in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, politics, or medicine.  

For instance, in [[Computational Theory]], some problems are considered intractable if they can't be solved efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) by any known algorithm. These problems often involve a high level of complexity and require significant computational resources to attempt to solve, even for relatively small inputs.

In a medical context, an intractable illness may refer to a disease or condition that is resistant to treatment. These cases require more intensive care and often involve more complex treatment strategies.

# Intractable Situations

Intractable situations usually refer to situations that are particularly hard to manage, manipulate, or control. They are commonly used in a political or sociological context. For example, intractable conflicts often have deep-rooted historical, cultural, or sociopolitical causes that make them difficult to resolve.

# Strategies for Dealing with Intractability

Despite the challenge, several strategies can be employed to deal with intractable problems or situations. These strategies vary depending on the specific scenario and may involve a high level of interdisciplinary collaboration.

# Conclusion

Remember, the term **'Intractable'** generally means 'hard to control or deal with'. Whether you come across it in a scientific paper, a political analysis, or a medical report, it signifies a high degree of complexity and a significant challenge.

In understanding contexts where the term 'Intractable' is used, itâ€™s important to also become familiar with fields such as [[Computational Theory]], [[Political Science]], and [[Medicine]] as they often throw light on the depth of the term's usage.
