## Overview

**Peer-to-peer (P2P)** refers to a network configuration where participants (peers) communicate directly with one another, without relying on intermediaries. In the context of blockchain and [[BSV Blockchain]], true P2P means transactions and interactions occur **end-to-end** between peers. This concept is foundational, as outlined in the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]], eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries while maximizing efficiency and trust.

## Characteristics of Peer-to-Peer Networks

### 1. **Direct Communication**
- Peers interact directly without routing through intermediaries such as central servers.
- Ensures that network participants can independently verify and exchange information.

### 2. **Decentralized Control**
- Each peer operates autonomously, sharing equal responsibility in network operations.
- No single entity has overarching control, adhering to the principles of [[Decentralisation]].

### 3. **Scalability**
- Distributes workload across peers, reducing bottlenecks and enhancing fault tolerance.
- Enables the network to scale horizontally without centralized infrastructure.

### 4. **End-to-End Verification**
- Transactions are validated directly at the network's edge using [[Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)]], bypassing the need for full-node validation or transaction lookups.

## P2P in the Context of BSV

### 1. **Transaction Workflow**
True P2P in BSV ensures transactions are:
1. **Created and Signed** by the sender.
2. **Sent Directly** to the recipient for verification via [[Simplified Payment Verification]].
3. **Finalized** by broadcasting to the core node network for inclusion in a block and broader visibility.

- **Edge Verification with SPV**:
  - Recipients use [[Merkle Proof]] and [[Block Headers]] to confirm transactions reference valid, unspent [[UTXO]]s.
  - This process provides confidence in the transactionâ€™s legitimacy without waiting for full block inclusion.

### 2. **Core Node Network**
While the core node network also operates on a P2P basis, it serves a distinct role:
- Facilitates **block announcements** and **transaction broadcasting**.
- Aggregates transactions into blocks for global consensus.
- Acts as a secondary layer, complementing direct P2P interactions for casual or instant payments.

## P2P vs. Peer-to-Miner-to-Peer

In systems like [[BTC]], users often rely on intermediaries (e.g., miners or full nodes) for transaction validation:
- Transactions are routed through miners before reaching recipients, breaking direct peer connections.
- This approach adds unnecessary latency and complexity, undermining true P2P workflows.
- Reliance on node services for transaction lookup prevents recipients from directly verifying their UTXOs.

**True P2P in BSV**:
- Transactions are verified directly between sender and receiver using SPV.
- Real-time, low-cost micropayments occur without intermediaries, ensuring seamless user experiences.

## Benefits of True P2P Networks

1. **Efficiency**
   - Eliminates intermediaries in transaction flows, reducing latency.
   - Supports real-time payments at minimal cost.

2. **Trustlessness**
   - Verification occurs directly between peers without relying on third parties.
   - Reinforces the original Bitcoin vision of a trustless network.

3. **Scalability**
   - Edge-based verification offloads workload from the core node network.
   - Promotes high transaction throughput and network scalability.

4. **Privacy**
   - Direct peer-to-peer exchanges reduce exposure to intermediaries and third parties.

## Misuse of the Term "Peer-to-Peer"

The term "P2P" is often misapplied in blockchain systems where workflows lack true end-to-end connectivity:
- **BTC**: Relies on miners or full nodes for validation, breaking direct communication between sender and recipient.
- Centralized systems masquerade as P2P while failing to deliver direct, independent interactions.

**True P2P** requires:
- Direct communication between peers.
- Verification at the edge using SPV.
- Independence from intermediaries for transaction validation.

## P2P in Core Node Messaging

The core node network operates on a distinct P2P layer to:
- Announce blocks and broadcast transactions.
- Aggregate transactions into blocks for network-wide consensus.
- Ensure consistency of the [[Longest Honest Chain]].

This layered separation supports scalability and network reliability while preserving the integrity of true P2P interactions.
