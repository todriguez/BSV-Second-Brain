## Overview

**Decentralisation** is a multifaceted concept that takes on distinct meanings depending on the context. It can refer to:

1. **Political Decentralisation**: The dispersion of decision-making authority, ensuring that no single group or entity can unilaterally control a system or protocol.
2. **Network Topology Decentralisation** (as per Baran 1964): A structural characteristic of a network where resources and operations are distributed, enhancing fault tolerance and resilience.

Both interpretations of decentralisation are crucial in understanding systems like [[BSV Blockchain]] and how they differ from other implementations such as BTC.

## Political Decentralisation

### Definition
Political decentralisation is the principle that no single entity or group can unilaterally dictate changes to a system or protocol. In the context of blockchain technology, it ensures that control over critical decisions, such as altering consensus rules, is not concentrated in a central authority.

### Decentralisation in BSV vs. BTC
1. **BSV**:
   - The [[Bitcoin]] protocol in BSV is **set in stone**, preserving the original design and intent outlined in the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]].
   - Changes to the protocol require broad consensus and are not dictated by any single group.
   - This aligns with true political decentralisation, where no entity has unilateral power.

2. **BTC**:
   - BTC Core frequently mutates the protocol, introducing significant changes such as [[SegWit]] and [[Taproot]].
   - These changes are often proposed and implemented by a central group of developers, undermining political decentralisation.
   - Commissioner Hester Peirce of the SEC has noted that a system is considered centralised if a single group can unilaterally make decisions, which applies to BTC Core's governance model.

### Importance
Political decentralisation ensures that:
- **Stability**: The protocol is predictable and reliable, crucial for long-term projects and enterprise adoption.
- **Fairness**: No group can impose changes that disproportionately benefit them at the expense of others.
- **Compliance**: Systems remain lawful and accountable under existing legal frameworks, avoiding potential classification as a security.

## Network Topology Decentralisation (Baran 1964)

### Definition
Baran's 1964 model categorises networks as **[[centralised]]**, **[[decentralised]]**, or **[[distributed]]**:
- **Centralised**: A single point of failure exists, making the network vulnerable.
- **Decentralised**: Resources and operations are spread across multiple nodes, reducing dependency on a single node.
- **Distributed**: Every node is equal, further eliminating central points of failure.

### Benefits of Decentralised Networks
1. **[[Fault Tolerance]]**:
   - Distributed networks are more resilient to node failures, ensuring continuity of operations.
2. **[[Scalability]]**:
   - Resources can be added incrementally without overburdening central nodes.
3. **Security**:
   - Distributing data and processes reduces the risk of centralised attacks.

## Challenges in Network Decentralisation

1. **[[Coordination]]**:
   - Decentralised systems can suffer from inefficiencies in coordinating resources and actions.

2. **[[Latency]]**:
   - Increased hops between nodes can lead to delays in communication and data processing.

3. **Security**:
   - Without proper safeguards, decentralised systems may still face vulnerabilities such as **[[Sybil attacks]]** or **collusion**.

## Near Complete Ultra Small World Mandala Network

BSV addresses the challenges of decentralisation with the **near complete ultra small world mandala network**:
- **Formation**:
  - The network topology emerges naturally from the incentives of the [[Bitcoin Protocol]].
- **Features**:
  - **Efficient Routing**: Minimises hops and reduces latency.
  - **Robustness**: Combines the fault tolerance of distributed systems with the efficiency of hierarchical coordination.
  - **Scalability**: Accommodates millions of [[Transactions]] per second while maintaining decentralised integrity.
- **Security**:
  - Combines [[Simplified Payment Verification]] (Simplified Payment Verification) and [[Chain of Digital Signatures]] for secure and reliable transaction validation.

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**            | Governance and decision-making authority                         | Distribution of resources and operations                         |
| **Examples**         | BSV's set-in-stone protocol vs. BTC's frequent mutations         | BSV's ultra small world mandala vs. traditional P2P networks     |
