**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)** is the latest iteration of the [[Internet Protocol]], designed to address the limitations of [[IPv4]] and support the ever-expanding global internet. It provides an extensive address space, improved routing efficiency, enhanced security features, and support for modern network demands, such as the [[IoT]].

## Key Features of IPv6

1. **Expanded Address Space**:
   - IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for approximately $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ unique IP addresses.
   - Example format: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
   - Supports hierarchical addressing and improved aggregation.

2. **Simplified Header Structure**:
   - The IPv6 header is streamlined for faster processing.
   - Fixed header size of 40 bytes, independent of optional extensions.

3. **Built-In Security**:
   - Includes mandatory support for **[[IPsec]]**, enabling encryption and authentication at the network layer.

4. **[[Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)]]**:
   - Devices can generate their own addresses automatically without requiring a [[DHCP]] server.

5. **Eliminated [[NAT]]**:
   - Restores end-to-end communication, improving efficiency and reducing latency.
   
6. **Enhanced Support for [[IoT]]**:
   - The vast address space of IPv6 is critical for the scalability of the Internet of Things.

## IPv6 Address Format

IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four [[hexadecimal]] digits separated by colons:
```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

### Address Types
1. **[[Unicast]]**:
   - Identifies a single interface. Data sent to a unicast address is delivered to that specific device.
2. **[[Multicast]]**:
   - Enables delivery to multiple interfaces in a group.
3. **[[Anycast]]**:
   - Data is delivered to the nearest interface in a group, as determined by routing metrics.

## IPv6 Header Format

| Field               | Size (bits) | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version             | 4           | IP version (always `6` for IPv6).                                                                       |
| Traffic Class       | 8           | Specifies traffic priority.                                                                             |
| Flow Label          | 20          | Identifies traffic flows requiring special handling (e.g., QoS).                                        |
| Payload Length      | 16          | Length of the data following the header, in bytes.                                                      |
| Next Header         | 8           | Indicates the type of the next header (e.g., [[TCP]], [[UDP]]).                                         |
| Hop Limit           | 8           | Decremented by each [[hop]]; [[packet]] is discarded when it reaches zero (similar to [[TTL]] in IPv4). |
| Source Address      | 128         | The sender's IPv6 address.                                                                              |
| Destination Address | 128         | The recipient's IPv6 address.                                                                           |

## IPv6 Extension Headers

IPv6 uses **[[extension headers]]** to provide optional network functionalities without increasing the base header size.

### Common Extension Headers
1. **[[Hop-by-Hop Options]]**:
   - Contains information that must be processed by every router along the path.
2. **[[Destination Options]]**:
   - Carries optional information for the destination node.
3. **[[Routing Header]]**:
   - Provides routing information for source routing.
4. **[[Fragment Header]]**:
   - Enables fragmentation of packets, though IPv6 discourages this at the network layer.
5. **[[Authentication Header (AH)]]**:
   - Ensures data integrity and authenticity.
6. **[[Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)]]**:
   - Provides encryption and confidentiality.

## Limitations of IPv6

1. **Transition Complexity**:
   - [[Dual-stack]] implementation (IPv4 and IPv6) increases management complexity during the transition.

2. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Older devices may lack IPv6 support, requiring upgrades.

3. **Training and Adoption**:
   - Network administrators need training to manage IPv6 networks effectively.
