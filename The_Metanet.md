**The Metanet** is the term given to a value-based internet built on the
Bitcoin SV ledger. The Metanet can be used to refer to either of
-   The concept of value-based internet built on [[Main Page|Bitcoin SV]].
-   The [[Metanet_Protocol|Metanet Protocol]].

The Metanet was first
[announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch)as a concept by Dr. Craig Wright at the CoinGeek Week
conference in London, on November 30th 2018.

The motivation for the Metanet, is the creation of a public ledger based
internet that functions as an efficient value network, which has
improved properties and
[[The_Metanet|capabilities]]compared to
the existing infrastructure of the Internet. The Metanet as a concept
has since been widely adopted by the Bitcoin SV ecosystem and many
protocols and applications have been built to implement the vision of a
highly-connected internet for peer-to-peer content creation and
monetisation.

# Core Principles

The motivations for the Metanet are linked to well-known problems with
the existing Internet and e-commerce, which include the following
-   Reliance on intermediaries for payments.
-   Lack of a granular [[Micropayments|micropayment]]layer.
-   Walled-garden applications and data silos.
-   Concerns over data privacy and ownership for users.
-   Prevalence of spam, trolling and bots in online social platforms.

The first two issues, relating to payment intermediaries and lack of
micropayments, are addressed by the use of the Bitcoin SV network for
simple payments. The Metanet aims to solve the remaining issues by
combining online payments with [[Immutable|immutable]]data stored on the Bitcoin SV public ledger.

The combination of payments and data both using the Bitcoin SV ledger as
a universal source of truth, theoretically allow for a more equitable
internet ecosystem in which
-   Information is attributed value.
-   Quality is incentivised over quantity.
-   The cost of dishonest behaviour (e.g. trolling) is increased.
-   Users own their data.

# The Metanet Protocol

The [[Metanet_Protocol|Metanet protocol]]is a
protocol for structuring data within the on-chain internet architecture
of the Metanet. The Metanet protocol uses a graph data model to create
on-chain data structures for Metanet applications, websites and use
cases. The protocol allows users to store, distribute and monetise their
data using its native permissions framework.

The Metanet protocol is a graph-based data structure protocol. The
protocol uses the native directed acyclic graph (DAG) data model of the
underlying Bitcoin SV ledger to create overlay DAG structures that exist
natively within the ledger\'s own structure. The nature of digital
signatures and transactions ensures there is a directionality to the
edges between vertices in contrast to an [[Acyclic_graph|acyclic graph]].
