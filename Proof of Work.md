# [[Proof of Work]] (PoW)

**Proof of Work (PoW)** is a consensus mechanism and signaling system used in [[Blockchain]] networks like [[Bitcoin]]. It requires participants (nodes) to perform computationally intensive tasks, demonstrating their commitment to the production of a verifiable [[Record of Events|record of events]]. This costly signal serves multiple purposes: establishing trustworthiness, incentivizing compliance with laws, and securing the network against malicious actors.

## PoW as a Signaling Mechanism

Proof of Work is akin to a [[Costly Signal]], like the extravagant tail of a peacock. It shows that a [[Node|node]] is highly competitive and has invested significant resources into creating a valid [[Blockchain|blockchain record]]. This investment creates an encumbrance for rewriting transaction histories, particularly for small casual payments.  

For **larger payments**, traditional financial safeguards such as [[KYC]] and legal compliance come into play. However, for smaller transactions, PoW ensures that the record is **non-reversible**, allowing for efficient, trust-minimized casual payments.

### Contrast with Proof of Stake (PoS)

- **Proof of Work**:  
  - Leverages competitive resource expenditure to secure the network.  
  - Investment in computational work creates economic leverage to ensure nodes comply with legal requirements.  
  - Open participation: Anyone willing to invest in computational resources can contribute.

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**:  
  - Relies on staking wealth to validate transactions.  
  - Critics argue it creates a system where the **rich get richer**, reinforcing economic inequality.  
  - Potential for centralization: Wealthy stakeholders dominate decision-making, undermining decentralization.

## PoW and Network Security

Proof of Work creates a financial barrier to attacking the network by making the cost of rewriting history or creating fraudulent blocks prohibitively expensive. The process also disincentivizes malicious actors since their investment in mining equipment and energy is at risk.

- **Casual Payments**:  
  For small transactions, PoW ensures non-reversibility without the need for additional legal or financial safeguards.

- **Large Payments**:  
  Subject to external compliance measures such as [[AML]] and [[KYC]], reinforcing security through legal frameworks.

## History of Proof of Work

1. **Origins**:  
   The concept of PoW predates blockchain and was first proposed in 1993 by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] to combat email spam. The term "Proof of Work" was formalized in 1999 by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels.

2. **Bitcoin's Implementation**:  
   [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] adopted PoW in the original [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]], using it to establish consensus in a decentralized network.

3. **Hardware Evolution**:  
   - **CPU Mining**: Early Bitcoin mining relied on general-purpose [[CPUs]].  
   - **GPU Mining**: [[GPU]]s soon replaced CPUs, offering higher efficiency for the [[Hashing|hashing]] operations required by PoW.  
   - **ASICs**: Application-Specific Integrated Circuits ([[ASIC]]s) eventually emerged, purpose-built for the specific PoW algorithms like [[SHA-256]]. ASICs significantly increased mining efficiency, though they also raised the barrier to entry.

## Technical Details

### Difficulty Adjustment

The [[Difficulty]] ensures that blocks are mined at a consistent rate, roughly every 10 minutes for Bitcoin. It adjusts based on the network's total computational power, increasing as more [[Hashrate]] is added. The process involves finding a hash below a specific target, which essentially means solving a cryptographic puzzle by finding a number that results in a hash with a required number of leading zero bits.

### Decoupling from Transaction Number

The PoW process is **decoupled from the number of transactions** included in a block. As the network scales, per-transaction efficiency increases, allowing high throughput without a linear increase in resource requirements.

## Economic Perspective

In economic terms, PoW exemplifies the principle "Judge them by their fruits." The investments miners make in computational resources ensure the reliability of the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with transaction fees and block subsidies, creating an economic incentive to maintain the network's integrity.

- **Market Efficiency**: Miners compete for rewards, driving innovation and energy optimization.  
- **Incentive Alignment**: Miners have a vested interest in securing the network, as their revenue depends on its continued operation.
