The **Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)** system was introduced as a formalized mechanism for proposing, discussing, and implementing changes to the [[Bitcoin]] protocol, software, or processes. Initially adopted by the Bitcoin Core project, the BIP process aimed to provide a structured method for submitting and reviewing technical enhancements or clarifications.

## Overview of the BIP Process

1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - Proposals were drafted in a standardized format that outlined the rationale, technical specifications, and potential impact of the proposed change.

2. **Community Review**:
   - Proposals were publicly discussed within the development community, often on forums or mailing lists.
   - Feedback, debates, and revisions were encouraged before advancing to the next stage.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Once a proposal achieved consensus, it could be implemented in the Bitcoin software by developers.
   - Adoption required miner and node operator agreement, making it a collaborative process.

## Deprecation of BIPs in BSV

In [[BSV Blockchain]], the BIP system has been **deprecated** in favor of the **Bitcoin Request for Comment ([[BRC]])** framework. The transition reflects BSV's commitment to restoring the original [[Bitcoin]] protocol as described in the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]] and ensuring that the protocol remains **set in stone**.

### Key Reasons for Deprecation:
1. **Protocol Stability**:
   - The BIP process enabled frequent and arbitrary protocol changes, which conflicted with BSV's principle of maintaining a stable, unchanging protocol.
   - Frequent changes risk fragmenting the ecosystem and complicating long-term development.

2. **Alignment with Original Vision**:
   - BSV prioritizes scalability and enterprise adoption, focusing on restoring rather than altering Bitcoin's original protocol features.
   - BRCs align more closely with BSV's goals by supporting enterprise use cases and real-world applications without introducing unnecessary changes.

## Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC)

The **BRC framework** used in BSV serves as a more structured and purpose-driven alternative to BIPs. Key characteristics include:

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - BRCs ensure that proposals do not disrupt existing systems or require enterprises to refactor their infrastructure.

2. **Enterprise Focus**:
   - Proposals focus on scalability, efficiency, and lawful compliance, addressing the needs of businesses and institutions.

3. **Preservation of Core Principles**:
   - BRCs operate within the bounds of the set-in-stone protocol, ensuring that any changes or extensions enhance functionality without altering the foundational rules.

## BIPs in BTC and Other Implementations

- **BTC (Bitcoin Core)**:
  - Continues to use the BIP system for proposing changes.
  - The process has been criticized for introducing contentious changes (e.g., [[SegWit]], [[Taproot]]) that deviate from Bitcoin's original intent.

- **BCH (Bitcoin Cash)**:
  - Similar to BTC, BCH adopts a more flexible approach to protocol changes, often diverging from the original Bitcoin principles.

- **BSV (Bitcoin SV)**:
  - By deprecating BIPs, BSV focuses on protocol stability and enterprise-grade features.

## Conclusion

The deprecation of the BIP system in favor of BRCs highlights [[BSV Blockchain]]'s commitment to restoring and maintaining the original Bitcoin protocol. While BIPs served as a tool for innovation in the early Bitcoin ecosystem, their frequent use for contentious changes has made them incompatible with BSV's vision of a stable, scalable, and enterprise-friendly blockchain.
