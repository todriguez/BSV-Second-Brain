# Block Reward

A **Block Reward** is a type of incentive that is awarded to **cryptocurrency miners** who have successfully solved the complex mathematical problems that are required to add a new block to the blockchain.

## Definition

The [[blockchain]] network employs a proof-of-work algorithm where miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems. The one who finds the solution first gets to create a new block and is awarded with the block reward. This mechanism drives competition and secures the network.

## Types of Block Rewards

There are generally two types of block rewards:

1. **Transaction Fees**: This is the aggregate of all transaction fees included in the transactions that are added to the new block. This is sort of a compensation to the miner for the computational resources used to validate the transactions.
2. **Block subsidy**: This is a certain number of new coins created “out of the nothing” and given to the miner as reward. This is also how new coins are introduced into the system. For example, in the case of [[Bitcoin]], the current block subsidy is 6.25 Bitcoins.

## Halving

The rate at which new cryptocurrency is released into the system is often halved at regular intervals to control inflation. This event, known as **[[Halving]]**, directly impacts the block reward. For instance, when Bitcoin was first launched, the block reward was 50 Bitcoins. Since then, there have been three halving events, decreasing the block reward to the current 6.25 Bitcoins.

## Block Reward as an Incentive 

The main function of the block reward is to serve as an incentive for miners to continue mining. Since the process of mining involves high computational and energy resources, these rewards provide the motivation for miners to continue the process. In addition, it also supports the decentralization of the cryptocurrency network as it encourages more participants into the system.
