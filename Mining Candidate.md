## Definition and Overview

A **mining candidate** is a proposed [[block]] prepared by a [[miner]] for submission to the [[blockchain]]. It includes a set of unconfirmed [[transactions]] chosen by the miner and their associated [[metadata]] in the form of a **[[Block header]]**. This header is passed to hashing machines for the [[Proof of Work]] process.

Under the **TeraNode paradigm**, where there is no global [[mempool]], the formation and propagation of mining candidates become increasingly dynamic and localized. Miners must manage their unique transaction sets and synchronize with peers in real time to ensure block validity in high-throughput environments.

## Mechanism and Functionality

### Formation of a Mining Candidate

1. **Transaction Selection:**
    
    - Transactions are selected from the miner's **local transaction pool** (unique to each miner due to the absence of a global mempool).
    - Selection prioritizes transactions offering higher [[transaction fees]] to maximize block rewards.
2. **Block Header Construction:**
    
    - The block header contains:
        - The [[previous block hash]]
        - The [[Merkle Root]] of the selected transactions
        - A timestamp
        - A nonce for PoW
3. **Dynamic Updates for Nonce Exhaustion:**
    
    - Due to the rapid exhaustion of the nonce field, the [[coinbase transaction]] is modified, altering the [[Merkle Root]] and enabling continued hashing with new candidate configurations.

### Mining Candidates in the TeraNode Paradigm

In a TeraNode system operating at high throughput (e.g., 1 million transactions per second):

- **Localized Transaction Pools:**  
    Each miner's transaction set is unique, reflecting the transactions received by their node, often in a different order from other miners due to [[latency]] and the **first-seen rule**.
    
- **Real-Time Transaction Sharing:**  
    To ensure that proposed blocks can be validated by other nodes:
    
    - Miners must share their transactions with peers in real time.
    - This reduces the need for other nodes to sync missing transactions before validating the block’s PoW.
- **Dynamic Mining Candidate Updates:**  
    At high throughput rates, transaction additions and changes require continuous updates to the [[Merkle Root]] and block header fields, resulting in a rapid stream of updated mining candidates.
    

### Implications of Decentralized Mempools

1. **Increased Communication Overhead:**
    
    - Nodes must propagate their transactions to peers as quickly as possible to ensure blocks can be validated without requiring transaction syncing.
2. **Latency-Driven Divergence:**
    
    - Variations in transaction order among miners increase the reliance on the first-seen rule, highlighting the importance of efficient real-time transaction propagation.
3. **Potential Use of Multicast Groups:**
    
    - For efficient distribution of transactions and mining candidates, multicast groups could play a critical role in minimizing communication redundancy.

## Applications and Importance

1. **Efficient Block Finalization:**
    
    - Mining candidates facilitate the systematic assembly, hashing, and validation of transaction blocks.
2. **Scalability in High-Throughput Systems:**
    
    - Dynamic mining candidate updates and real-time transaction sharing are essential for supporting systems with millions of transactions per second.
3. **Interoperability Among Miners:**
    
    - Transaction sharing ensures that proposed blocks can be validated quickly across nodes, maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.
