## Overview 

Named after [[Bitcoin]]'s creator, [[Satoshi Nakamoto]], 'Satoshis' are the smallest unit of the Bitcoin currency recorded on the [[Blockchain]]. It represents one hundred millionths of a single Bitcoin # [[Satoshis]]

[[Satoshis]] are the **smallest fungible unit** on the [[BSV Blockchain]], equivalent to \(0.00000001\) [[BSV Blockchain]]. All satoshis were issued with the [[Genesis Block]] and are distributed through the block subsidy as part of the [[Coinbase Transaction|coinbase transaction]].

## Key Characteristics of Satoshis

### Fungibility and Distribution

- **Smallest Unit**: Satoshis are the base denomination of [[BSV Blockchain]], enabling precise transactions and microtransactions.  
- **Genesis Block Issuance**: All satoshis were issued at the blockchain's inception in the [[Genesis Block]].  
- **Block Subsidy**: Satoshis are distributed to [[Miners]] as rewards for creating new blocks.  

### Recirculation and Transaction Fees

- **Transaction Fees**: Satoshis are recirculated into the system through transaction fees, providing a "fresh start" when included in new [[Coinbase|coinbase transactions]].  
- **Economic Alignment**: Every satoshi can be traced back to its coinbase transaction through a verifiable [[Chain of Digital Signatures|chain of digital signatures]]. This ties economic actions on the blockchain to their digital signatures rather than relying solely on addresses.

## Satoshis as Data Carriers

Satoshis can also serve as **data carriers**, as seen in protocols like [[1Sat]]. 

- **Data Payloads**: A satoshi can carry arbitrary data, enabling additional functionality on the [[BSV Blockchain]].  
- **CBDC Representation**: Satoshis can also represent denominations in a [[CBDC]], such as a $100 digital bill, while the fee for transferring it could be just 1 sat.  

### Minimum Output Requirements

Every transaction must include at least one 1-sat output to maintain the integrity of the [[UTXO|UTXO model]] and avoid transitioning into an account-based system. This requirement ensures that all actions on the blockchain remain linked to [[Digital Signatures]] rather than being decoupled and relying solely on addresses.

## Fees in the BSV Network

Currently, transaction fees on the [[BSV Network]] are 1 sat per [[KB]]. This makes satoshis highly practical for:

- **Microtransactions**: Facilitating small payments, such as casual purchases or tipping.  
- **Large Value Transfers**: Representing larger denominations while maintaining efficient fee structures.

## Practical Uses of Satoshis

### Scalability and Precision

- **Global Currency Potential**: With 21 million BSV capped, satoshis expand the usable supply to 2.1 quadrillion units.  
- **[[Micropayments]]**: Enables day-to-day transactions with precision and ease.
