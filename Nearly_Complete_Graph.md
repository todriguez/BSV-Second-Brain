# Nearly Complete Graph

A Nearly Complete Graph, often referenced in computer science and mathematics, is a special type of graph. Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to understand the fundamental concepts, such as what a [[Graph]] is and the different types of [[Graph Theory]].

## Definition

A Nearly Complete Graph is usually defined as a graph where there is a direct path between nearly every pair of nodes. This means that for every two vertices (or nodes), there is an edge connecting them, except for one or few.

## Application

The Nearly Complete Graph is attributed to various applications, particularly in network routing and [[Computer Algorithms]]. For example, the [[Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)]] is a classic problem that often makes use of Nearly Complete Graphs.

## Difference from Complete Graph

A Nearly Complete Graph should not be confused with a **[[Complete Graph]]**, which is a graph wherein there is a unique edge (direct path) between every pair of nodes without any exception. The key difference is that in a Nearly Complete Graph, there could be one or a few pairs of nodes that don't have a direct path linking them unlike in a Complete Graph.

## Conclusion

The concept of the Nearly Complete Graph is a distinctive and vital principle in Graph Theory. It is utilized in several computational problems and is a fundamental concept in understanding how data structures are interconnected.
