**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)** is the fourth iteration of the Internet Protocol, a fundamental technology for routing and addressing data packets across networks. Introduced in the early 1980s, IPv4 became the dominant protocol for internet communication and remains widely used today. However, its design has faced significant challenges due to the exponential growth of connected devices.

## Structure of IPv4

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numeric identifiers, typically represented in **dotted decimal notation**:
```
192.168.1.1
```
Each address is divided into four 8-bit (1 byte) octets, separated by dots, yielding a theoretical maximum of **4,294,967,296** unique addresses.

### Components of IPv4
1. **Network ID**:
   - Specifies the network segment to which a device belongs.
2. **Host ID**:
   - Identifies a specific device within the network.

## Limitations of IPv4

### 1. **Address Space Exhaustion**
- With only ~4.3 billion unique addresses, IPv4 cannot accommodate the growing number of connected devices in the modern era, especially with the advent of IoT.
- Private networks and technologies like [[Network Address Translation (NAT)]] attempt to mitigate this but have drawbacks.

### 2. **Inefficient Address Allocation**
- Legacy allocation strategies assigned large blocks of addresses, leading to underutilization.

### 3. **Security Concerns**
- IPv4 was not designed with robust security features such as authentication or encryption.

### 4. **[[Routing Table]] Bloat**
- The global routing tables have grown significantly due to address fragmentation, increasing the overhead for network hardware.

## Attempts to Address IPv4 Limitations

### 1. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
- [[NAT]] allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IPv4 address.
- Works by translating private addresses (e.g., `192.168.0.x`) into a public address at the router level.

#### Benefits of NAT
- **Address Conservation**:
  - Extends the usability of IPv4 by reducing public address demand.
- **Basic Firewalling**:
  - Hides private network devices from external attackers.

#### Limitations of NAT
- **Increased [[Latency]]**:
  - Address translation adds processing overhead, impacting performance.
- **Security Risks**:
  - Can obscure device identities, complicating audit trails and security monitoring.
- **Breaks [[End-to-End]] Connectivity**:
  - Makes peer-to-peer communication and protocols like VoIP more complex.

### 2. **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**
- Introduced to improve address utilization by replacing the classful addressing system.
- Allows more flexible subnetting and aggregation.

### 3. **IPv4 Address Leasing**
- Temporary address allocation using protocols like **[[DHCP]] (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.

## Why IPv4 Limitations Matter

The limitations of IPv4 have hindered scalability and introduced inefficiencies in modern networking, particularly with the growth of IoT. Key issues include:
1. **Fragmented Addressing**:
   - Complicates network design and increases routing complexity.
2. **Latency Issues**:
   - NAT introduces additional steps in packet processing.
3. **Security Challenges**:
   - Lack of built-in authentication and encryption mechanisms.

## Transition to IPv6

The limitations of IPv4 necessitated the development of [[IPv6]], which addresses these challenges by:
- Expanding the address space to **128 bits**, enabling ~340 undecillion unique addresses.
- Simplifying routing and improving network efficiency.
- Providing built-in security features, such as [[IPsec]].

While IPv4 remains in widespread use due to legacy infrastructure, its limitations make IPv6 adoption critical for supporting future technologies, including [[IoT]] and next-generation networking.
