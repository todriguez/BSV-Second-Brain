# False Return

The term 'False Return' broadly relates to situations where a system or function incorrectly signals having successfully accomplished its designated task.

## Overview

False Return often comes into play in the context of computing and information systems. An example might include a software function tasked with the retrieval of specific data from a database. [[Database Operations]] A False Return would occur if the function, due to a bug or other issue, incorrectly indicated that the data retrieval was successful when, in fact, it was not.

## Implications

The implications of a False Return can be severe as it gives the false assurance that a task or operation has been completed successfully. Such an assurance might lead to subsequent steps being performed based on the erroneous belief that all is well. This can result in inaccurate outputs, compromised data integrity and potential system crashes. 

## Handling False Return

False Returns should ideally be caught during the testing phase of a software development cycle. [[Software Testing]] However, should they make it to a live environment, contingent plans can be put into action. 

For developers, one possible approach is to design functions and methods with safeguards in place for "sanity checks". These entail making sure that the returned value or state indeed logically aligns with the other elements of the system. A higher-level strategy is to develop comprehensive and robust error and exception handling systems throughout the application, to catch and report any anomalies.
