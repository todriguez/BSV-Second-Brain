# Cryptography

Cryptography is a method of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format. This technique ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, and becomes essential in computer systems, especially in secure communications.

## Introduction

Cryptography involves writing using various kinds of code, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The prefix "crypt-" comes from the Greek word for "hidden" or "secret". Hence, [[cryptography]] is closely related to the procedures of cryptology, which collectively encompass the disciplines of encrypting and decrypting data.

## Types of Cryptography

There are mainly three types of cryptography:

1. **Symmetric-key cryptography:** In this cryptography both the sender and receiver share a single key. The sender uses this key to encrypt plaintext and sends the ciphertext to the receiver. On the other side, the receiver applies the same key to decrypt the message and retrieve the plaintext.

2. **Asymmetric cryptography:** Also known as public key cryptography, it is a system in which the sender and receiver have a pair of cryptographic keys: a public encryption key and a private decryption key. 

3. **Hash Functions:** No key is used in this algorithm. A fixed-length hash value is computed according to the plain text.

## Cryptographic Algorithms

Various cryptographic algorithms exist to serve these purposes. Examples include:
- [[RSA Algorithm]]
- [[Diffie Hellman Algorithm]]
- [[Data Encryption Standard]]
- [[Advanced Encryption Standard]]

Each of these algorithms has strengths and weaknesses, them suitable for different applications.

## Importance of Cryptography

In the digital age, where cyber attacks are a potential threat, cryptography plays a key role in ensuring data privacy, protecting data integrity, and entity authentication. Its effective use provides a layer of security against cyber threats, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
