# Satoshi Nakamoto

**Satoshi Nakamoto** is the pseudonymous creator of [[Bitcoin]], the groundbreaking peer-to-peer electronic cash system introduced in the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]]. Satoshi's work laid the foundation for modern blockchain technology, combining cryptography, computer science, and economics into a system that provides trustless, immutable transactions. Satoshi's identity remains unknown, and speculation about it has been avoided in this entry.

## Contributions

### 1. **Bitcoin and the Whitepaper**
- Satoshi Nakamoto issued all Bitcoin and authored the **[[Bitcoin Whitepaper]]**, outlining the technical and conceptual framework for a decentralized [[Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System]].
- The whitepaper serves as a **technical manifesto**, providing a high-level overview of Bitcoin's design, including its use of the [[Longest Honest Chain]], [[Chain of Digital Signatures]], and [[Proof of Work]] consensus mechanism.

### 2. **Copyright and Licensing**
- Satoshi retains **copyright** over Bitcoin as its issuer, and certain components of the system were released under the **MIT License**, which permits modification and redistribution under specific terms.

### 3. **Bitcoin's Development History**
- Satoshi released the original Bitcoin software on **SourceForge**, where its code and early discussions were publicly available.
- After the involvement of additional contributors, the project was moved to **GitHub**, and the **Bitcointalk forum** was established.
  - Importantly, Satoshi was not given administrative privileges on Bitcointalk.
  - Only archival copies from [[Bitcoin.org]] and SourceForge comments are authentic representations of their intent.

## Writings and Vision

### 1. **Writings as a Contract**
- Satoshi’s writings, particularly the Bitcoin Whitepaper, can be interpreted as a **unilateral or multilateral contract** for miners and participants:
  - Miners following the six steps outlined in **Section 5** of the whitepaper, which describe how transactions are verified and blocks are added, are contributing to the **Longest [[Honest Chain]]**.
  - By maintaining a **[[set-in-stone protocol]]**, miners uphold the system's integrity and are rewarded with the block subsidy and transaction fees.

### 2. **Protocol Integrity**
- Satoshi did not suggest that Bitcoin's protocol should be ceded to parties seeking to mutate or alter its core design.
- Changes to the protocol, made through collusion between exchanges and miners or by developers altering the rules, deviate from Bitcoin's original intent.

## Governance and Law

### 1. **Miners as Enforcers**
- Miners do not **develop rules** but **enforce them**, ensuring the network's operation aligns with the rules laid out in Bitcoin's protocol and the broader framework of [[law]].
- The rules miners enforce are immutable unless consensus is achieved according to the principles of the longest honest chain.

### 2. **Rules as a Subset of Law**
- Satoshi’s design emphasized lawful operation, where rules serve as a subset of the law. This ensures Bitcoin can operate within legal frameworks and maintain accountability.

## Legacy

Satoshi Nakamoto’s contributions to cryptography and digital systems extend far beyond Bitcoin itself. The framework Satoshi created serves as the basis for all modern blockchain systems, though many have diverged significantly from the original vision.

## Key Historical Facts

1. **Bitcoin's Release**:
   - Published on SourceForge in 2009 with comments and explanations by Satoshi.

2. **Archival Authenticity**:
   - Only SourceForge archives and Satoshi’s original communications on [[Bitcoin.org]] are considered authentic and reflective of their intent.

3. **Departure from Public Involvement**:
   - Satoshi stopped publicly engaging with the project in 2010, leaving behind a foundational system designed to operate autonomously and under specific rules.

4. **No Ceding of Authority**:
   - Satoshi did not state an intention to cede Bitcoin’s future to developers or groups that mutate the protocol or violate its foundational principles.
