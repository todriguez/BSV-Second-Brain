An **acyclic graph** is a type of [[graph]] in which there is no sequence of edges or vertices that can be traversed to loop back to the original vertex. 

## Overview 

In other words, an acyclic graph has no [[cycles]]. A [[cycle]] in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges that start and end at the same vertex. Thus, there are no repeated vertices and edges in an acyclic graph.

There are several types of acyclic graphs with unique properties and applications. A [[tree]] is an example of an acyclic graph. Another common type is the [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG), which is a directed graph with no directed cycles.

## Properties

1. **Uniqueness of the Path**: In an acyclic graph, there is a unique path between any pair of vertices. That is, there is only one way to get from one vertex to another.
2. **Tree-like Structure:** If all components of an undirected graph are tree structures, then the graph is acyclic.
3. **Initially Disconnected:** A graph could initially be disconnected and still be acyclic. 

## Applications

Here are a few examples of applications where acyclic graphs are commonly found:

1. **Dependency networks:** Acyclic graphs are perfect for representing dependencies in scheduling and planning problems.
2. **Software builds:** The process of building software often includes dependencies on other pieces of software, which can be represented as a directed acyclic graph.
3. **Genetics:** Acyclic graphs can represent inheritance relationships in genetics.

Remember, when understanding the concept of an acyclic graph, it is crucial to understand the notions of [[graphs]], [[vertices]], [[edges]], [[cycles]], and [[connected vs disconnected graphs]].
