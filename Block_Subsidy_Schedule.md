The algorithmically defined distribution of bitcoins to nodes over time
as the block subsidy. The subsidy started at 50 bitcoins per block and
is halved every 210 000 blocks until all bitcoin have been distributed.
This distribution will be complete around the year 2140.

The Block Subsidy Schedule can also be known as the Inflation Schedule
since it defines how frequently new coins are added into circulation.
