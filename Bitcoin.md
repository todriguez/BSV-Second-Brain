# Bitcoin

**Bitcoin** is a revolutionary **peer-to-peer electronic cash system** first defined in the technical manifesto known as the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]]. At its core, Bitcoin is more than just a cryptocurrency or an exchange ticker; it is an **[[information commodity ledger]]** built on the principles of **[[Proof of Work]]**, **[[digital signatures]]**, and **[[immutability]]**.

## Defining Characteristics of Bitcoin

### 1. **The Longest Honest Chain**
- Bitcoin is defined by the **longest honest chain**:
  - This chain adheres to all consensus rules.
  - It does not include invalid transactions.
  - It respects the constraints of the original protocol, including a fixed supply of satoshis.

The phrase "longest chain" refers not to the chain with the most accumulated Proof of Work but the chain that remains honest by following the protocol's rules.

### 2. **Chain of Digital Signatures**
- Each transaction in Bitcoin carries a **[[chain of digital signatures]]**:
  - The [[Private Key]] of the sender signs the transaction.
  - The corresponding [[Public Key]] verifies the signature.
  - This creates an unbroken chain of ownership and accountability.

### 3. **A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**
- Bitcoin facilitates direct payments between individuals without reliance on intermediaries.
- It is a system for **low-cost, scalable, and secure financial transactions**, aligning with the stated goal in the Bitcoin Whitepaper.

## Bitcoin as an Information Commodity

Bitcoin functions as an **information commodity**:
- **Data Ledger**:
  - It is a ledger of all transactions, timestamped and carried as satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin).
- **Information Commodity**:
  - Satoshis can carry transactional metadata, acting as programmable digital units.

This unique capability allows Bitcoin to extend beyond simple payments into areas like [[data integrity]], [[digital identity]], and information management.

## Various Implementations of Bitcoin

### 1. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)**:
- BSV most closely aligns with the original stated purpose and technical specifications outlined in the [[Bitcoin Whitepaper]]:
  - All opcodes are enabled, supporting the rich programmability of Bitcoin Script.
  - Unlimited block size ensures scalability for global adoption.
  - Adheres to the principle of the longest **honest chain**.
  - Set in stone protocol with all file formats, opcodes and data structures being backward compatible.

### 2. **Bitcoin (BTC)**:
- The BTC implementation deviates significantly:
  - Imposed block size limits reduce transaction throughput, making it unsuitable as a global payment system.
  - Prioritizes being a "store of value" rather than peer-to-peer cash.
  - Omits or disables many features of the original protocol, such as scalable transaction capacity.

### 3. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**:
- BCH made efforts to restore some aspects of the original protocol:
  - Increased block size compared to BTC.
  - Focuses on payments but lacks the commitment to the original protocol's comprehensive functionality.
  - Fails to scale unboundedly and disables critical features of Bitcoin Script.

### Choosing the True Bitcoin:
- **BSV** stands as the **most authentic implementation** of Bitcoin:
  - It restores and maintains the original protocol set in stone.
  - It scales to meet global demands.
  - It retains Bitcoin's utility as an **electronic cash system** and **information commodity ledger**.

## Misconceptions About Bitcoin

1. **More Than an Exchange Ticker**:
   - Bitcoin is not defined by its ticker symbol (e.g., BTC, BCH, BSV) but by its adherence to the original protocol and intended purpose.

2. **Beyond Proof of Work**:
   - Proof of Work alone does not define Bitcoin. The network must also enforce consensus rules and maintain technical integrity.
