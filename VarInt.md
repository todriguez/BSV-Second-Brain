# VarInt

VarInt, or Variable Length Integer, is a common form of space-efficient encoding for numbers. This method conserves space by utilizing an integer's most significant bits for additional information.

## Overview

VarInt uses a form of serialization that stores an integer in a variable number of bytes. The smaller the integer value, the less amount of bytes are needed to store it. This approach is mainly used when the most frequent numbers are quite small, but there could also be occasional large numbers to be stored. VarInts are most beneficial when used in database systems and data structures where storage efficiency is essential.

## How VarInt Works

VarInts use a unique method to encode and decode numbers. They use the least significant 7 bits of each byte in the sequence to quantify the number. The most significant bit in each byte is used as a continuity flag. 

A VarInt starts with the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. It continues encoding into the following bytes, adding one byte for every 7 bits of the number until all bits are encoded. If the most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is set to 1, it indicates that the sequence will continue into the next byte.

## Practical Application

VarInts are often used in databases like [[Google's Protocol Buffers]] and [[LevelDB]] where saving space is critical. By reducing the amount of space required to store individual integers, these systems can save on storage capacity, boost performance, and also improve retrieval speed. 

## Conclusion

By offering a compact and efficient way to store integer values, VarInts are an essential piece of the puzzle in the functioning of space-efficient data systems or databases. Despite their complexity, their benefits of space saving and increased performance make them invaluable in the right contexts.
