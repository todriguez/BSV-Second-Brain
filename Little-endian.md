# Little-Endian

The term 'little-endian' refers to an order in computer memory for storing multi-byte data types, where the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lower memory address. This method is also referred to as computing architectures that follow this order.

## Overview

In a 'little-endian' system, the LSB, also known as the 'little end', is stored in the lowest address. Conversely, the most significant byte (MSB), often referred to as the 'big end', is stored in the highest allocated address. 

For example, in a little-endian system, a 4-byte integer `0x12345678` would be stored as `(0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12)` in the sequential memory addresses. This might seem counter-intuitive when viewed in memory, which is one of the frequent criticisms of little-endian systems. However, they have their advantage when performing arithmetic operations which often begin with the LSB. 

## Comparison with Big-Endian

In contrast to [[Little-Endian]], the 'big-endian' architecture stores the most significant byte in the smallest address. In big-endian, the example integer from above would be stored as `(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78)`. Big-endian is deemed to align more with the natural left-to-right reading style of the human perspective.

The choice between little-endian and big-endian can have impactful consequences on the system or application design, as internal communications within a computer, and external communications such as network protocols, may follow different endian conventions. 

## Applications and Use Cases

Little-endian architecture is used in many popular processors, including the x86 and most ARM processors that power PCs and mobile devices respectively. These processors often employ a bi-endian mode where they can operate either in little-endian or big-endian, depending on the prerequisite. 

Understanding the endian-ness of the system is crucial while programming low-level data handling or while communicating data between different systems. 

## Conclusion

In essence, 'little-endian' is a flavorful artefact of the digital world that underlies much of our computational infrastructure. Understanding it better not only gives you a deeper comprehension of how computers work but also assists in dealing with some significant system-level issues.
