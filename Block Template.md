## Definition and Overview

A **block template** is a preliminary structure of a potential [[block]] prepared by a mining node or pool. It contains all the necessary components for hashing but does not yet include the dynamic adjustments needed for full mining operations. Block templates are integral to the mining process, especially in **[[pooled mining]]**, where they provide a common starting point for distributed mining efforts.

## Components of a Block Template

1. **Selected Transactions:**
    
    - Transactions chosen from the [[mempool]] based on factors like [[transaction fees]] and miner policies.
    - The transactions are organized into a [[Merkle Tree]], and the resulting [[Merkle Root]] is included in the block header.
2. **Block Header Fields:**
    
    - [[Previous Block Hash]]: References the hash of the preceding block.
    - **Merkle Root**: Represents the hash of all selected transactions in the block.
    - [[Timestamp]]: Reflects the current time, as perceived by the mining node.
    - [[Bits]]: Specifies the target difficulty for the block.
    - [[Nonce]]: Initially set to 0 or a default value, subject to modification during mining.
3. **Coinbase Transaction:**
    
    - A special transaction that pays the block reward (subsidy + [[transaction fees]]) to the miner.
    - Includes miner-specific data, such as an extra nonce field, to enable dynamic updates.
4. **Metadata:**
    
    - Instructions for workers, including ranges of nonces or extra nonces to be used.

## Use in Pooled Mining

In pooled mining, the pool operator generates a block template and distributes it to individual hashers. Hashers then:

1. Modify the [[coinbase transaction]] to adjust the Merkle Root.
2. Hash the resulting [[Block header]] using assigned nonce ranges.
3. Return a valid [[Proof of Work]] to the pool upon success.

## Differences Between Block Templates and Mining Candidates

1. **Static vs. Dynamic:**
    
    - A block template is static, containing pre-selected transactions and initial metadata.
    - A mining candidate is dynamic, continuously updated during the hashing process.
2. **Role in the Workflow:**
    
    - Block templates are distributed to miners or workers.
    - Mining candidates are created by miners from block templates by modifying the coinbase transaction and iterating through nonce and extra nonce values.

## Importance of Block Templates

1. **Efficiency in Mining Pools:**
    - Enable distributed hashing by providing a consistent starting point for workers.
2. **Transaction Inclusion:**
    - Define which transactions will be included in the next block, affecting transaction fees earned by miners.
3. **Scalability:**
    - Facilitate high-throughput mining operations by preparing data for real-time processing.
