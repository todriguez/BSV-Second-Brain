A configurable consensus rule that dictates the maximum possible block
size that a node will consider valid. There is currently no limit for
this parameter with the limit manually configured for each node.

Node operators set their maximum size based off the risk for making it
too large and producing a block on a minority hashpower chain, or the
opportunity cost for making it too small and missing out on fees.
