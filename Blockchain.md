# Blockchain

## Introduction

A **Blockchain** is a system of recording information in a way that which makes it difficult or nearly impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. The blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across an entire network of computer systems.

## Working Mechanism

Every block in the chain contains a number of transactions. When a new transaction takes place on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. 

The decentralized nature of the network is what makes the blockchain secure. In order to change, add or omit any information, the majority of nodes on the network must agree upon the modification. This means a single entity with malicious intent wouldn’t be able to change blocks in the chain.

## Applications

Blockchains have a wide range of applications. The most popular among them is to support the transaction of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other than that, Blockchain can be used to authenticate the transfer of property, the origin of physical and digital goods, etc.

## Benefits

- **Security**: The cryptographic principles applied to create the Blockchain make it secure against fraud and hacking.

- **Transparency**: Since Blockchain is a completely transparent public ledger, a record of all transactions can be viewed by everyone in the network.

- **Decentralization**: There is no central authority in a Blockchain, making it a decentralized technology. 

## Limitations

Despite many benefits, Blockchains also have their limitations. The most significant barriers are technological, regulatory, and societal:

- **Scalability**: The ability of Blockchains to process large amounts of transactions per second (TPS) is still far less in comparison to traditional financial services.

- **Privacy**: More transparency can sometimes mean less privacy, and this can result in less security and more vulnerability to attacks.

- **Regulation**: The legal status of Blockchain technologies is very uncertain, and varies greatly from country to country. 

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that promises to greatly change computer transactions and the trade of value. Its model of complete transparency stands in stark contrast to the opaque manner in which transactions and trade take place over the Internet today.
