In the context of a [[Bitcoin transaction]], **change** refers to the portion of [[spendable transaction outputs (STOs)]] that is returned to the sender when the [[input STOs]] used in the transaction exceed the intended [[transaction amount]]. This mechanism ensures that any excess value in a transaction is not lost and remains under the control of the original sender.

## How Change Works

When constructing a Bitcoin transaction, the sender typically specifies:

1. The [[input STOs]] to be spent.
2. The [[output STO]] for the intended recipient (containing the specified transaction value).
3. The **change output**, which directs the remaining balance back to the sender's control.

The sum of the [[output STOs]] (recipient and change) must always be less than or equal to the sum of the [[input STOs]], with the difference accounted for as the [[transaction fee]].

### Example of Change in a Transaction

1. A sender has an input STO of 0.05 BTC.
2. The recipient is to receive 0.03 BTC.
3. The sender specifies a transaction fee of 0.001 BTC.
4. The remaining 0.019 BTC (0.05 - 0.03 - 0.001) is sent back to the sender as **change**.

This change is recorded as a separate STO in the transaction, with a [[lockScript]] (e.g., a [[P2PKH]] script) that ensures only the sender can spend it.

## Importance of Change Outputs

- **Efficient Fund Usage:** Change allows users to spend their funds without precisely matching input and output values.
- **Privacy Implications:** The inclusion of a change output can sometimes reveal details about the sender's [[wallet]] structure if not carefully managed.
- **Script Complexity:** Change outputs can involve sophisticated [[locking conditions]], especially in transactions using [[Smart Contract]] or [[multisig]] arrangements.

## Change Address

In practice, change is often sent to a separate address controlled by the sender, called a **change address**. Using change addresses enhances [[privacy]] by making it harder to associate inputs and outputs with a single entity. However, improper reuse of change addresses can compromise this privacy.

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Dust Outputs:** If the change amount is too small, it may result in a [[dust]] output that is uneconomical to spend due to high transaction fees.
2. **Address Reuse:** Reusing the same change address can weaken the sender's privacy by linking multiple transactions.
3. **Transaction Design:** Poor transaction design, such as omitting a change output, can lead to unintentional loss of funds if the excess value is misdirected.

## Mitigation Strategies

- Use unique change addresses for each transaction to enhance privacy.
- Avoid creating dust outputs by carefully calculating the transaction fee and output amounts.
- Leverage wallet software that automates change output management for improved security and usability.
