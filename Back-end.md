## General Definition

The **back-end** of a system refers to the server-side architecture and logic that handles data processing, storage, and interaction with the client-side (front-end). It serves as the backbone of an application, managing complex tasks such as database interactions, authentication, and server-side computations. The back-end ensures that user-facing components work seamlessly by providing the necessary data and functionality.

## Components of a Back-End

1. **Server**:
   - Hosts the application and processes requests from the front-end.
   - Examples include [[Apache]], [[NGINX]], and Node.js.

2. **Database**:
   - Stores and retrieves data based on application requirements.
   - Common databases include [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], and [[MongoDB]].

3. **Application Logic**:
   - The core functionality of the application, implemented in back-end programming languages like [[Python]], [[Java]], or [[Go]].

4. **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
   - Defines the methods and endpoints through which the front-end interacts with the back-end.
   - Commonly implemented as REST or [[GraphQL]] APIs.

## Back-End in the Blockchain Context

In blockchain-based systems, the **back-end** often takes the form of an **[[overlay service]]**, providing essential support for managing transactions, application state, and interaction with the blockchain network.

### Responsibilities of a Blockchain Back-End

1. **Transaction Construction**:
   - Constructs transactions following predefined [[schemas]].
   - Ensures transactions conform to the protocol's rules (e.g., [[UTXO Model]] in [[BSV Blockchain]]).

2. **UTXO Lookup**:
   - Manages the state of Unspent Transaction Outputs ([[UTXO]]s).
   - Performs lookups to identify available UTXOs for new transactions.

3. **Partially Signing Transactions**:
   - Partially signs transactions when multiple signatures are required.
   - Ensures the integrity of [[multi-signature]] workflows.

4. **Global Application State Management**:
   - Tracks a **global state** representing the entire systemâ€™s operational context.
   - Provides users with a **partial state** view relevant to their interactions.

5. **Client-Side Interaction**:
   - Presents transactions to the front-end or client side for final signing and broadcasting to the network.
   - Facilitates interaction between users and the blockchain.

6. **Overlay Services**:
   - Enhances blockchain functionality without modifying the core protocol.
   - Examples include identity systems, [[CBDC]]s, [[Data Storage Overlays]].

## Benefits of a Back-End in Blockchain Applications

1. **Scalability**:
   - Offloads complex operations (e.g., UTXO management) to dedicated servers, allowing the front-end to remain lightweight.

2. **User Experience**:
   - Simplifies blockchain interactions for end-users by abstracting complex operations like [[Bitcoin Script]] execution.

3. **Security**:
   - Ensures transactions are constructed securely before being signed and broadcasted.
   - Reduces the risk of errors in user-initiated transactions.

4. **Compliance**:
   - Enables businesses to integrate regulatory requirements (e.g., [[KYC]] and [[AML]]) through overlay services.

## Example Workflow in a Blockchain Back-End

1. **UTXO Management**:
   - The back-end performs a lookup to identify suitable UTXOs for a transaction.

2. **Transaction Construction**:
   - Constructs a transaction based on application-specific schemas and user inputs.

3. **Partial Signing**:
   - Signs the transaction partially, leaving user-specific components for the front-end to complete.

4. **Presentation to Front-End**:
   - Sends the prepared transaction to the user for final signing.

5. **Broadcasting**:
   - Once signed, the transaction is broadcasted to the blockchain network.
