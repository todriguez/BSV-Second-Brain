## Introduction

A **Byte** is one of the fundamental units of data storage in computers. It's widely used in computer science, digital information storage, and processing. Understanding what a byte is, helps in understanding the architecture of both software and hardware.

## Definition of Byte

A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of **8 bits**, where every [[bit]] (binary digit) represents either a 0 or a 1. This unit of measurement is crucial for digital storage systems and is commonly assigned with the symbol **B**.

## Importance of Byte

Bytes are critical in the world of computing, they're as fundamental to digital information as atoms are to matter. Every instruction [[CPU]] (Central Processing Units) reads and every character you see on a screen is composed of bytes.

For example, consider a text file that has only one character 'a'. This file would typically use one byte for storing it. 

## Larger Units

Bytes can also be represented in larger blocks such as [[Kilobytes]] (KB), [[Megabytes]] (MB), [[Gigabytes]] (GB), [[Terabytes]] (TB) and so on. Each of these is a multiple of a byte â€“ a kilobyte being 1024 bytes, a megabyte being 1024 kilobytes and so on. This is typically how storage devices like hard drives, USB drives, memory cards and others specify their storage capacity.

**Please note**: another system in use similar but different from the one above is the SI system of decimal prefixes, in which a kilobyte is 1,000 bytes, a megabyte is 1,000,000 bytes, etc. This system is usually used for data transmission rates and storage sizes in some fields.
