The word Timechain can be used to refer to the nature of the Bitcoin
[[Blockchain|Blockchain]]as a chain of timestamped
events in history. Transactions themselves do not have a timestamp
component and as such are attributed with the timestamp of the
[[Block|Block]]they end up being included in. It is
possible to include more accurate timestamp information in a Bitcoin
transaction as part of an [[Application_layer_protocol|Application layer protocol]]however this must be done with the explicit intent of a secondary system
existing, that can interpret the time in the format used in the
transaction payload.
