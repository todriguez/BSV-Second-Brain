# Digital Signatures

## Overview

A **digital signature** is a cryptographic artifact used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, transaction, or digital document. It serves as a digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal, but it is far more secure. A digital signature is generated using [[Public-Key Cryptography|public-key cryptography]], specifically a private key, and can be validated with the corresponding public key.

In legal and practical terms, a digital signature only functions as a valid signature when it is bound to an [[Identity|identity]].

## How Digital Signatures Work

1. **Signing**:  
   A digital signature is generated by applying a cryptographic algorithm to the data being signed (e.g., a [[Transaction|transaction]] or document) using a **[[Private Key]]**. This process produces a unique cryptographic artifact.

2. **Verification**:  
   The recipient uses the associated **[[public key]]** to verify the authenticity of the signature. If the verification succeeds, it proves that:
   - The data was signed by the holder of the private key.
   - The data has not been altered since it was signed.

3. **Binding to Identity**:  
   To make a digital signature legally binding, the key used for signing must be registered against an [[Identity|identity]]. This requires prior registration of the identity against the key, as identity cannot be retroactively attributed to a key.

## Digital Signatures in [[BSV Blockchain|BSV]]

In the context of BSV, digital signatures are fundamental to the blockchain’s functionality. They are used to:

1. **Validate Transactions**:  
   Each [[Transaction Input|transaction input]] must include a digital signature proving ownership of the associated [[UTXO|STO]] being spent.

2. **Enable [[Smart Contract|Smart Contract]]**:  
   Scripts on the [[BSV Blockchain|BSV blockchain]] use digital signatures for advanced validation, ensuring transactions meet specific conditions.

3. **Secure Data**:  
   Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of data payloads stored on-chain, such as hashes embedded via [[OP_RETURN]].

### Key Considerations in BSV

1. **Identity and Compliance**:  
   - Digital signatures in BSV are cryptographic proofs but become valid signatures under the law only when linked to an [[Identity|identity]].
   - The system supports [[Bitcoin Certified Addresses (BCA)|Bitcoin Certified Addresses]] and identity binding mechanisms to establish compliance and accountability.

2. **Possession of Keys ≠ Identity**:  
   Possessing a private key does not equate to having legal identity. [[Identity]] must be established and linked to the key beforehand to enable signatures to have legal weight.

3. **Cryptographic Proofs and Legal Validity**:  
   - The output of a digital signature algorithm is a cryptographic artifact.
   - Legal systems require this artifact to be bound to a specific identity for it to function as a signature in a legal context.

## Applications of Digital Signatures

1. **Authentication**:  
   Digital signatures validate the identity of the sender and ensure secure communication in systems like [[Peer-To-Peer_Protocol|peer-to-peer protocols]].

2. **Integrity Verification**:  
   Signatures confirm that the data has not been altered during transmission or storage, ensuring integrity in [[Data Payloads|data payloads]].

3. **Accountability in [[Smart Contract]]**:  
   In BSV, digital signatures enforce contractual obligations by ensuring that only authorized parties can execute specific actions.

4. **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**:  
   Identity-bound signatures enable compliance with legal frameworks, including [[Know Your Customer (KYC)|KYC]] and anti-fraud regulations.

## Types of Digital Signature Schemes

1. **ECDSA** ([[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]]):  
   The primary signature scheme used in BSV, leveraging the [[secp256k1]] elliptic curve for high efficiency and security.

2. **Schnorr Signatures**:  
   A more compact and efficient alternative to ECDSA with support for multi-signature aggregation, implemented as a protocol change in BTC.

Digital signatures are a cornerstone of both cryptographic security and legal accountability in blockchain systems. While cryptographic artifacts ensure the integrity and authenticity of data, their legal standing as signatures depends entirely on their binding to a verifiable [[Identity]]. In [[BSV Blockchain]], these principles are critical for enabling compliant, scalable, and secure applications.
