# ASCII

## Overview

**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a character encoding standard that uses binary codes to represent text and other characters in computing. Each character is assigned a unique numerical code, represented as a sequence of 7 or 8 bits. While widely used for text representation, ASCII differs significantly from formats like binary, hexadecimal, and decimal, particularly in cryptographic operations where precise handling of data formats is crucial.

## How ASCII Works

### Binary Representation
Each ASCII character is encoded as a sequence of binary bits:
- The standard ASCII table uses 7 bits, allowing for 128 characters.
- Extended ASCII uses 8 bits, supporting 256 characters.

For example:
- The character `A` is represented as `65` in decimal or `01000001` in binary.
- The character `a` is represented as `97` in decimal or `01100001` in binary.

### Increased Byte Storage
Representing characters in ASCII introduces overhead:
- Each character requires at least 1 byte (8 bits) for storage, even if fewer bits would suffice for specific applications.

## ASCII vs. Other Formats

### ASCII vs. Binary
While ASCII encodes characters into binary sequences, it inherently adds an abstraction layer:
- `0xff` in binary (a single byte with all bits set) is different from the ASCII representation of `0xff`, which requires multiple bytes (`0x30 0x78 0x66 0x66` in hexadecimal, corresponding to `0xff` as a string).

### ASCII vs. Hexadecimal
In hexadecimal:
- `0xff` represents the single byte `255`.
In ASCII:
- The string `0xff` represents multiple characters encoded as their ASCII values.

For example:
- Hashing `0xff` as a hexadecimal byte produces a different result than hashing the ASCII string `"0xff"` because the latter expands into a sequence of bytes based on character codes.

### ASCII vs. Decimal
ASCII is also distinct from decimal representation:
- The decimal value `65` is numerically equivalent to the binary `01000001`, but in ASCII, it represents the character `A`.
- Misinterpreting ASCII-encoded data as raw numbers can cause significant errors in cryptographic operations.

## ASCII in Cryptographic Operations

### Importance of Format Consistency
In cryptographic operations like hashing, the format of input data matters:
- Hashing the ASCII string `"123"` produces a different result than hashing the binary or decimal representation of `123`.

For example:
- ASCII `"123"` is represented as `0x31 0x32 0x33` (hexadecimal).
- Decimal `123` is represented as a single byte `0x7b`.

### Risks of Using ASCII
1. **Increased Storage Overhead**:
   - ASCII expands data into multiple bytes, increasing the size of input for cryptographic functions.
   
2. **Ambiguity**:
   - Data must be interpreted correctly to avoid inconsistencies. For example, the string `"255"` in ASCII and the binary byte `0xff` represent entirely different data.

3. **Encoding Vulnerabilities**:
   - Improper encoding or decoding of ASCII data can lead to cryptographic weaknesses or errors, particularly when interoperating with systems expecting raw binary or hexadecimal formats.

## Best Practices with ASCII in Cryptography

1. **Avoid Ambiguity**:
   - Ensure input data is explicitly defined in terms of its encoding (e.g., binary, ASCII, hexadecimal) before hashing or signing.

2. **Use Consistent Formats**:
   - Convert ASCII strings to binary or hexadecimal formats when performing cryptographic operations to reduce storage overhead and avoid misinterpretation.

3. **Validate Input**:
   - Verify the encoding of data to prevent unintended consequences, such as hashing `"0xff"` as ASCII instead of the intended single-byte value.

4. **Minimize ASCII Usage**:
   - When possible, use compact formats like binary or hexadecimal directly in cryptographic workflows to streamline processing and reduce the risk of errors.

## Examples

### Hashing ASCII vs. Hexadecimal
Hashing the ASCII string `"0xff"`:
- Input: `0x30 0x78 0x66 0x66`
- Output: Hash of the four-byte sequence.

Hashing the hexadecimal `0xff`:
- Input: `0xff` (a single byte).
- Output: Hash of the single byte.

### Representation Differences
- ASCII `"A"`: `0x41` (single byte for the character `A`).
- Decimal `65`: `0x41` (numeric value without character encoding).
- Hexadecimal `0x41`: Represents the same binary value but interpreted differently in cryptographic contexts.
