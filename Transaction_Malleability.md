# Transaction Malleability 

Transaction malleability is a term associated with the digital cryptocurrency, [[Bitcoin]]. It refers to the possibility of changing the unique identifier—also known as the transaction ID—of a Bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the Bitcoin network. 

## Understanding Transaction Malleability 

In a perfect system, once a transaction has been created it shouldn't be alterable. However, with Bitcoin transactions, it's technically possible to alter how a transaction appears, without impacting the underlying transfer of funds. This alteration impacts the transaction ID. 

Let's clarify this with a simple example, suppose Alice is sending 1 Bitcoin to Bob. The transaction details—the sender (Alice), the recipient (Bob), and the amount of Bitcoin—are wrapped up into a transaction and signed digitally by Alice. This transaction is then assigned a unique transaction ID and sent into the Bitcoin network for confirmation. However, before this transaction is confirmed, it's possible to alter its digital signature thereby changing the unique transaction ID while retaining the original transaction details. This phenomenon is known as Transaction Malleability.

## Impact of Transaction Malleability 

The primary issue with transaction malleability lies within implementations of the Bitcoin protocol that aren't prepared for the possibility. This can lead to problems. For instance, suppose Alice runs a service that immediately creates a new transaction once she receives a confirmation of received funds via a transaction ID. If the transaction ID was changed due to malleability, Alice might not recognize the incoming funds which can lead to inaccurate transactions.

## Fixes and Updates

In reaction to these issues, several updates have been implemented to fix these vulnerabilities. The [[Segregated witness]] (SegWit) update is one such major fix. It fundamentally changes the way transactions are created and packaged, eliminating the issue of transaction malleability.

It's important to note that transaction malleability still exists theoretically, but due to updates and fixes, the opportunity for vulnerability has been largely minimized.
